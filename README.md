# Snake Game Using Genetic Algorithm

> The project objective is to implement a version of classical Snake game with PyGame and apply Genetic Algorithm, where the movements of the snake are determined by a genetic algorithm that evolves over time to create more efficient and effective game strategies. 
> DEMO
This project is intended for the "Nature Inspired Computing" course at Innopolis University.

## Set up
To run this project, run the following commands in the repo root directory:
1. Create virtual environment
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Make sure you have a compatible version of Python 3.9.13 before running the code since it was tested on that version.
